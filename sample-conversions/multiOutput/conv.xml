    Whenever we have more than one code section at the first level,
    each of them gets a full copy of the specified source file.

    In this example we create Target1.java and Target2.java with the source from
    Source.java. The contents of the source are translated for the first target,
    while they are just copied to the second one.

    Although this is a simple example, it demonstrates an important capability
    of the system.
