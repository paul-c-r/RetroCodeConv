    This example demonstrates how to deal with converting many functions in one
    source file. It does so by creating a container code section for the class,
    and then using function code sections as children for the processing.
    The children are in the conv.components.xml file.

    All the code sections are declared to process only once and one of
    the child code sections is used twice (id=2).

    The STRING child removes the FOR statement and replaces it with a simple
    assignment on the string. The other functions do a simple translation from 10 to 99.
